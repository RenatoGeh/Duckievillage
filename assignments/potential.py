# Intro to Robotics - MAC0318

#
# Assignment 4 - "Catch"
# Carefully read this header and follow submission instructions!
# Failure to follow instructions may result in a zero!
#
# Task:
#  - Implement the potential field algorithm to play catch with Mr. Duckie.
#
# Don't forget that you can (and should!) read the Duckievillage code in search of anything that
# can be useful for your work.
#
# Don't forget to run this from the Duckievillage root directory!
# From within the root directory, run python with the -m flag.
#   python3 -m assignments.potential
#
# Submission instructions:
#  0. Add your name and USP number to the header's header.
#  1. Make sure everything is running fine and there are no errors during startup. If the code does
#     not even start the environment, you will receive a zero.
#  2. Test your code and make sure it's doing what it's supposed to do.
#  3. Append your NUSP to this file name.
#  4. Submit your work to PACA.
